You can download the sample code at your SVN/TFS repository: http://bo.codeplex.com/

The repository is being updated over time with new samples.

Just start browsing at http://bo.codeplex.com/SourceControl/BrowseLatest

Then browse to the Native / Delphi folder and see all the examples.

You can also use SVN to get the most recent version from https://bo.svn.codeplex.com/svn

In the root directory you will find a file "Version-control-URLs.txt" that contains a list of other repositories that are interesting, and on which some of our examples depend on.
